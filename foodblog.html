            Summer food is all about freshness, hydration, and light flavors. During the hot season, people prefer foods
            that keep the body cool and energized, such as fruits, salads, smoothies, and cold beverages. Watermelon,
            mangoes, cucumbers, yogurt, and coconut water are popular summer choices. Street foods like ice creams,
            popsicles, and chilled desserts also become favorites. Healthy summer meals help prevent dehydration and
            provide essential nutrients while keeping digestion light.Summer food plays an important role in keeping the
            body cool and healthy during high temperatures. Seasonal fruits like berries, pineapples, oranges, and
            papayas are rich in water and vitamins, making them ideal for summer consumption. Light meals such as
            salads, sandwiches, and grilled vegetables are preferred over heavy or oily foods. Homemade drinks like
            lemon juice, buttermilk, and fruit juices help maintain hydration. Eating fresh and natural foods during
            summer improves energy levels and overall well-being.

            milkshakes are loved by people of all ages. Many cultures also prepare traditional summer dishes that help
            cool the body, such as curd-based meals and fermented drinks. These foods not only taste refreshing but also
            protect the body from heat-related issues.</p>
